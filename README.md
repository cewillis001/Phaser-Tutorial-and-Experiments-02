Experiments for CEN 4021 project

Attention teammates: experiment3.html is the version that successfully impliments switching characters.
It does this by creating two sprites with two seperate animation sets. Then, in the update function, there is a flag.
Which character goes about doing what is determined by the state of the flag. For more than two characters we should
probably use a switch statement.
